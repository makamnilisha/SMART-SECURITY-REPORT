# Smart Security Solution for Women based on Internet Of Things(IOT)

Usually in all the security alert solutions initial action has to be triggered by victim which is often not possible in such situations, through this project I wanted to build a system that works autonomously or by easy actions.

The objective of this project is to 
Provide security to women, help the guardian know the condition of the victim.
Send information to people in near vicinity requesting public attention via wearable device.
and finally, help track the co-ordinates of the victim using GPS.

The proposed system is that when a problem is detected, first communication is with the user. If the user does not respond, next attempt is to contact members in his/her social network. If either fail or the social contact confirms a problem, the system alerts an emergency service(police).

Developing such an Android application which is an alert system for PROBLEM detection “iPROB”, was a great experience.
